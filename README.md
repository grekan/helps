# Helps

New-style help files for Prophecy the MUD.

Usage: `pwhelp <name>` in-game.


## Notes

These were originally generated via ProphWiki and some Perl, which did assorted formatting and wrapping and templated in the banner.

They're rendered as-is in-game, which currently means hand-wrapping and copying the banner yourself.

Eventually they'd ideally move to something [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/index.html)-like.

Consistency is key when editing these files. For instance, all clans should move towards pwhelp <clanname> rather than help <clanname> for PK clans and help clan_<clanname> for player clans.
