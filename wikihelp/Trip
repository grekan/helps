 * Trip <target>

 Back by popular demand, trip is a somewhat dastardly attack and involves using
any one of a number of methods to bring your opponent down to the ground.
Tripping large monsters is generally not a good idea and agile ones will find
the attack easy to avoid.  Thieves and warriors may learn trip.
