 * pkonly <item>

 PKonly is a command available to Player-Killers, which makes their equipment
useable only by other Player-Killers.  You may not transfer PK-only equipment
to non-PKset characters.  However, non-PKonly equipment may be given to a PK
player.  If a non-pker is in possession of eq with the pk_only flag, that 
character will be forced to PKset.
