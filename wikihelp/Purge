`8Syntax:`` 

 * purge
 * purge <character>

 Purge is used to clean up the world.  Purge with no arguments removes all the
NPC's and objects in the current room.	Purge with an argument purges one
character from anywhere in the world. 

 Purge will not get rid of PC's, or objects or mobiles with a NOPURGE flag set
(i.e. the pit, the fountain, shopkeepers, Toth).  Mobiles may be purged if they
are called directly by name.
