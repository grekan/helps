`` Skills and spells are, alongside your statistics, the backbone of your
character. Every class has a different set of skills that you can use after you
have selected them at the creation of your character. For a list of your
current skills and/or spells, just type skill or spell. For further information
on skills and spells read the specific helpfiles on them (ie. `&help bash`7).
Some information on how to get better at skills and spells can be found in
`&help newbie_training``. ``
