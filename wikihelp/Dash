`8Syntax:`` 

 * dash <direction> <command>

 This is the ability to run very quickly into a room and act before anyone has
a chance to react.  In other words, you get to run into a room and perform one
action (backstab, attack, cast, etc) before anyone can do anything. There is no
way for a target mobile/player to perform an action before a dashing player.
