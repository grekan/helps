The Bearcult (BC) is a group of religious fanatics who strive to reunite Aloria
 and to take over the other Western Kingdoms eventually the world. This means
they  often wage war against the Guardians of the West for lands they consider
theirs.  The cultists are known for their lack of reason and would do
everything for their one and only god, Belar. ``
