The '`#pending``' command will show you the options available. To take each one
in turn: 

'`#pending add``' :
	adds a new task to the list. You should include a title for the task as
an argument to the command enclosed in quotation marks. eg pending add 'Process
so-and-so's builder app' 

'`#pending list``' :
	shows you the list of tasks. You see:  An id number so that you can
refer to the task with the other commands. An optional '`#*``' if the task has
a further description associated with it. The number of days since the task was
added to the list. The task title. The name of the immortal who has taken on
the task. 

'`#pending list new``' :
	shows you new or changed tasks since you last looked at the list. 

'`#pending list <name>``' :
	shows you all tasks assigned to <name>. 

'`#pending list unclaimed``' :
	shows you all unclaimed tasks. 

'`#pending done``' :
	shows you recently completed tasks. The fields shown are as for the
'pending list' command, but also shows each task's status since removed tasks
will also show up here. 

'`#pending done new``', '`#pending done <name>``', and '`#pending done
removed``' :
	correspond to the same or similar options to the 'pending list'
command. 

'`#pending show <id>``' or '`#pending info <id>``' :
	show you the full information about a task. This includes who set it
and and a description. (Tasks with further descriptions appear with '`#*``'
next to them on 'pending list'). 

'`#pending claim <id>``' :
	claims a task on the list as yours. This is just advisory, you can
claim a task that is already assigned to someone else. It is also possible to
claim removed tasks. 

'`#pending unclaim <id>``' :
	Unclaims a task that is listed as yours. 

'`#pending complete <id>``' :
	Moves a task assigned to to you to the completed board. 

'`#pending remove <id>``' :
	Remove a task that is assigned to you but do not mark it as complete.
This can be used for impossible or otherwise inappropriate tasks. It is
possible for removed tasks to be claimed by someone else. 

'`#pending edit <id>``' :
	Optionally takes a new task title as an argument enclosed in quotation
marks. Then you will find yourself in the append mode editor to type a full
description for the task. 

 When you log on you will automatically do a 'pending list new', just as you do
an 'unread'. I hope this is not too intrusive.
