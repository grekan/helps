 * cast 'frenzy' <target>

 The frenzy spell fills the target with righteous fury, greatly increasing his
or her attack skill and damaging capacity.  Unfortunately, this divine wrath is
coupled with a tendency to ignore threats to personal safety,  making the
character easier to hit.  Frenzy provides immunity to the calm spell (see 'help
calm'), and may only be used on those of the caster's  alignment and the same
god.
