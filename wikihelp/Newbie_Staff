`` Prophecy has a staff of so-called immortals, dedicated to upholding the law
of the MUD, as well as enhancing the the game enviroment. All immortals on
Prophecy have a name of a character from the books. You can find a list of the
current staff by typing "`!wizlist``". If you wish to speak to an immortal and
you see none online, you can attempt to reach them using the `^pray`` channel.
Please refrain from spamming on this channel though, if you aren't contacted
swiftly there is probably no immortal online. ``
