Spies are a marginal class. They do few things better than any other class, but
have the widest range of skills available.  Spies are specialists at thievery
and covert actions, being capable of entering areas undetected where more
powerful adventurers would fear to tread.  They are better fighters than
priests, but lack the wide weapon selection of warriors. 

 All spies begin with the dagger combat skill, and are learned in steal as 
well.  Any other weapon skills must be purchased, unless the default selection
is chosen.  This default skill package includes: 

 skills: 

 * mace 	   the use of maces and other blunt weapons
 * sword	   swordplay and fencing
 * backstab	   the art of hitting your opponent by surprise
 * disarm	   used to deprive your opponent of his weapon
 * dodge	   the best way to take a punch is not to be there
 * Second Attack   with training, the skilled thief can hit twice as fast
 * trip 	   a good way to introduce an opponent to the floor
 * hide 	   the art of remaining undetected in a room
 * peek 	   used to look into a person's belongings
 * Pick Lock	   a useful skill for breaking and entering
 * sneak	   with this skill, a thief can walk into a room undetected
