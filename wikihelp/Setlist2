Weapons V1 and V2 determine the avg dam. 

   Command: set obj <obj> v? <number>	Example: set obj holy v1 5	     
set obj holy v2 6 

  The holy avenger has dam 5d6 which means avg dam 18	If the total damage is
over 1200 it causes a bug, so please   don't make any weapons more than avg dam
around 100.
