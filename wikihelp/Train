 * train <str int wis dex con hp mana>

 Train increases one of your attributes.  When you start the game, your
character has standard attributes based on your class and several initial
training sessions.  You can increase your attributes by using these sessions at
a trainer (there are several in town). 

 It takes one training session to improve an attribute by 1 or to increase mana
or hp by 10.  You receive one session per level.
