`8Syntax:``  

 * delete <enter>, delete <enter>

 Use the delete command to erase unwanted characters, so the name will be
available for use.  This command must be typed twice to delete a character, and
you cannot be forced to delete.  Typing delete with an argument will return
your character to 'safe' status if you change your mind after the first delete.
