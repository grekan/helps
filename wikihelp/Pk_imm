 * pk forcenextweek

 This should only be done if the MUD is down at the change of midnight on
Sunday or if, for some reason, the PK ranking system does not give rewards and
reset by 00:01 system time of what would then be Monday.  This will force the
PK ranking code into end of the week manually. 

 See also 'help prizepool' for more information on prizes awarded.
