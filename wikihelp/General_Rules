These rules are the rules that all players are obliged to learn. Playerkiller
or  not, you must follow them. If you break these rules you may receive
penalties  without a warning. These rules are not subject for interpretation by
anyone other  than the Immortals, see help interpretation. The words listed
below point to	files on rules.  Failure to abide by these can result in many
penalties, including  deletion or sitebanning.

 We have made an effort to make these rules cover as many cases as possible.
However, it's impossible to cover everything. If an immortal tells you that
your action is illegal then it is illegal, even though it might not be listed
above.	As long as you use your common sense and respect the immortals, it is
very  unlikely that you will find yourself in such a situation. If you feel you
have  been punished too harshly, or didn't break a rule, note Anheg. If you 
are pk set or if you ever decide to go pk then you must also read help
pk_rules.
