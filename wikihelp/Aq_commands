Prophecy has its own unique Automatic Questing System. The following is a
summary of the commands that that you need to know to use the system. All
commands below start with "aquest" such as "aquest start" 

 `8Syntax:`` 

 start:

seek out a shopkeeper or a healer who is need of assistance from a brave
adventurer such as yourself 

 request:
	 Once you have found the shopkeeper or healer that you seek, this
command will cause them to set you a task that you must complete. There are 4
forms that such a task can take:	: Delivery - You will be given a letter
which must be delivered to the stated person. Give the letter to the recipient
and then return to the person who sent you.	 : Mob kill - Slay the mob you
are sent for and return in one piece!	  : Retrieve - Retrieve the item and
bring it back.	     : Retrieve2 - Same as above, only the item you are sent to
retrieve is an existing item in the game, for example, basilisk claws. 

 complete:
	 Once you have done what your aquest giver sent you to do, return to
them, type 'aquest complete' and they will see that you are well rewarded for
your troubles. Bear in mind that your rewards will be greater if you do not use
certain transportation spells whilst on your aquest, and if you are using MCCP.

your hard-earned aquest points (aqps or aqpts) on.
