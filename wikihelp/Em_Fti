In each of the 15 rounds of her Find The Immortal Quest, Emily hides in a
random room in the world, and gives prizes of decreasing value to the first,
second and  third person to find and tag her using the "`&emily tag``" command.
By reading the	description of the room she is in, Emily gives everyone the
means to track her  down. 

 It is against the rules to use the gate and portal spells in this quest, and
Emily  will not be pleased if you try it!
