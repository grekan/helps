`` `#Question`3: `&Will I be able to keep my equipment?`` `` 

 `@Answer`2:`` `& 

 No. Part of the reason for the pwipe is to rid people of equipment so that
nobody has a piece that exceeds the limits. The only way to ensure that, and to
make sure everyone starts out the same, everything concerning your characters
will be  deleted. This will include standard stock equipment, quest equipment
and aquest  equipment. ``
