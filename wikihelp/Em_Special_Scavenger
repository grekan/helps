In this Quest Emily asks each person to collect items from a list she will give
 you. When she says so, you must go to her room and type "`&emily getlist``" to
find  out which items you should look for, and collect a cooking pot to store
them in. You then  have 4 minutes to collect as many of the listed items as you
can, using the hints  about which areas you can find them in that Emily
provides. The more of the 20  items you retrieve in the net, the better your
prize will be. Note that the listed  Special Item is worth more than the
others, but is also likely to be harder to  obtain. 

 Emily will give a warning when there is one minute of the Quest left. You
should then start making your way back to Sendar so you and trade in with her
in time. To  do so, "`&emily cashin cook``" while in her room. 

 Please note that gating is impossible for the duration of this Quest. You may
no longer cash in donated items, so spend your time searching the world rather
than  raiding the donation rooms for items. Using items collected in a hostel
room  before the Quest to boost your score is illegal and will be punished with
a  Noquest and the loss of any prizes thus gained.
