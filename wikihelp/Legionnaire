Legionnaires are the forces of Tolnedra. They are trained only in fighting
since magic is forbidden in their country. Due to this training they have grown
very strong and act for good and sometimes even for evil, whatever suits them
best. They are very addicted to gold and will do almost anything if they get a
lot of gold for it.
