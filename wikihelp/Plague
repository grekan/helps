 * cast 'plague' <target>

 The plague spell infests the target with a magical disease of great virulence,
sapping its strength and causing horrific suffering, possibly leading to death.
 It is a risky spell to use, as the contagion can spread like wildfire if the
victim makes it to a populated area.
