 The ASTRING command takes an existing piece of equipment and has a questmaster
change its identity. To use ASTRING you must fit into these requirements- *
Have 200 autoquest questpoints
 * Be in the same room as a questmaster
 * Have the item you want to restring

 Definitions of the command parameters- 
nameofobj:
	the current name of the object you want restring 
new name:
	the new name you set for your object this name is used for commands
like wield, hold, etc	    NOTE: do NOT use colors in the name field 
short description:
	this is the description that shows up in your inventory and when your
wielding your weapon for example, this is the text that gets seen the most 
long description:
	this is the description that shows when the object is on the ground or
when you look at it, a good policy for beginners is to make this identical to
short desc. 

 A good policy for beginners is to BE CAREFUL, there's no going back, make sure
you understand this help file before trying. If you are still unclear ask
another player for help. Also, you CAN use colors in all fields except the name
field, just put them in like normal.
