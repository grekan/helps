In the words of one wise warrior, 'the best way to block a blow is to not be
where it lands'.  The dodge skill honors this tradition, by improving the
character's natural agility to the point where many blows will miss the 
target. The chance of dodging is also affected by the dexterity of the attacker
and the target.  Any class except legionnaires may learn dodging.
