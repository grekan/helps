Prophecy's economy is based on `3gold`7 and s`7i`8lv`7e`7r coinage. One
`3gold`7 coin is  worth 100 s`&i`8lv`&e`7r coins, but is also four times as
heavy. 25 `3gold`` coins weigh 1 pound, as opposed to 100 s`&i`8lv`&e`7r coins
to a pound. `` Money can be used to buy various things in shops, as well as bid
 on items being auctioned. S`&i`8lv`&e`7r can be converted to gold  and vice
versa at changers, for example Otho (`&help otho`7). Gold can also be 
deposited in banks to be stored for future use (`&help bank`7). ``
