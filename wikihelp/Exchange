`8Syntax:``  

 * give <amount> silver <changer mobile>
 * give <amount> gold <changer mobile>

 Certain mobiles are flagged as "changers", supporting the exchange command to
convert gold to silver, and the reverse.  The exchange rate is 100 silver to 1
gold, although changers charge a 10% fee. As an example, Otho is found in the
same room as Nathalie, in the Sendar Bank. For directions there, type help
bank.
