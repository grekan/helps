Area attacks are certain spells or skills that hit every mob in the same room
as you. This can be dangerous because it will cause all hit mobs to turn and
fight you. If you are PKset and there are other PKset players in the room when
you cast an area attack spell, they will also turn and attack you. Examples are
sweep and earthquake.
