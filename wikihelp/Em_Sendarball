10 seconds before the start of each SendarBall match, all Questors will be 
assigned to either the Red or Blue Teams, and transferred to the goal room that
 your team must defend. In the 10 seconds before kickoff it is legal to
position  yourself anywhere on the pitch but not to attack the opposition. At
kickoff, two  'ball mobiles' will appear in the center room of the pitch. The
aim of the game is  to push the other team's colour ball into the goal room
which you are attacking.  It is legal to attack the opposing team's players
during the game to prevent them  from scoring. In addition, you may attack your
own ball, with the aim of 'bursting'  it or preventing it from being pushed. If
you succeed in bursting your own team's  ball, a new ball will be created back
in the center room. SendarBall balls are  notoriously hard to control, however,
and will often bounce out of combat and away  to safety. 

 SendarBall has a team of phycisians on hand to patch up the inevitable
fatalities that occur in the course of a  typical game. If you are killed
during the match,  you will receive treatment and will then be transferred back
into the center room  and back into the game. 

 SendarBall Quests are run in a sequence known as a World Tour. Each new Quest
will  be on a new pitch somewhere in the world. Emily will post her customary
results  qnote after each match detailing both the results of the current Quest
and the  details of where the next one will be held. It is advised that if you
intend to  play in a SendarBall quest that you work out in advance the layout
of the pitch,  to save time once the Quest itself begins.
