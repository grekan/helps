`8Syntax:`` 

 * cast haste <target>

 The haste spell increases the speed and agility of the recipient, allowing an
extra attack (or even a backstab) in combat, and improving evasive abilities in
combat.  However, it produces a great strain on the body such that recuperative
abilities are halved.  Haste is capable of negating the slow spell. (see 'help
slow').
