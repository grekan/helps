`8Syntax:``  

 * push <target> direction

 Push moves the intended target in the direction you specify.  It is dependent
upon your strength.  If you are not stronger than your target, you will not be
able to push the target.  If you are attempting to push a mob, it will attack
you if it is of higher level.  You may only push the target if they are
standing.
