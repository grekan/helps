`8Syntax:`` 

 * stat <name>
 * stat mob  <name>
 * stat obj  <name>
 * stat room <number>

 The stat command gives you detailed information on an object, mobile, or room
within the game.  Without a class argument, the command will return a object
(if found), a mobile (if no object exists, but a mobile does), or a room  (if a
number is  given).  Stat room with no argument stats the room you are standing
in.  Stat can be used to find room vnums for goto (see also goto, transfer).
