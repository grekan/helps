 * scribe '<spell>'

 The scribe skill allows those that have it to scribe their own spells onto
clean parchments that must be bought in Sendar. You must hold a parchment in
your hand. You can scribe up to three spells onto a scroll, and every time you
scribe a spell, there is a chance that it can either burn up and harm you or
fail and disappear into thin air.
