 * cast 'chain lightning' <target>

 Chain lightning is a deadly spell, producing a powerful bolt of lightning that
arcs from target to target in the room, until its force is fully expended.
Allies of the caster may be hit by this spell if they are members  of a clan,
while the caster himself will not be struck unless no other viable target
remains. Chain lightning is most effective when used on groups of creatures.
