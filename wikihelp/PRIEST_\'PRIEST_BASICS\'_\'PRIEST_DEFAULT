Priests are the most defensively orientated of all the classes.  Most of their
spells focus on healing or defending the faithful, with their few combat spells
being far less powerful than those of mages. However, priests are the best 
class by far at healing magics, and they possess an impressive area of
protective magics, as well as fair combat prowess. 

 All priests begin with skill in the mace.  Other weapon or shield skills must
be purchased, many at a very dear cost.  The default skill selection for 
clerics is as follows: 

 skills: 

 flail: 	  The proper use of flails 

 spell groups: 

 attack:	  A selection of offensive magics 

 creation:	  The making of physical objects, such as food and water 

 curative:	  Spells that cure the sick and feeble of their ailments 

 benedictions:	  Powerful magics that grant the blessings of the gods 

 detection:	  Informational magics, such as detect magic and identify 

 healing:	  Spells for treating wounds, from scratches to death blows 

 maladictions:	  An assortment of curses 

 protective:	  Defensive magics, including the powerful sanctuary spell 

 transportation:  Spells for getting from here to there 

 weather:	  Spells for conjuring and mastering the elements
