Followers of the Bear-god, Belar, these people form much of the Western nations
in the world. Split into four different groups after the recovery of the Orb by
Belgarath and his companions, the Alorns consist of the Chereks, Drasnians,
Rivans, and Algarians. 

 Being the children of Belar, and under the watchful eyes of the Disciples of
Aldur, they are often in conflict with the Angaraks, who follow Torak.
