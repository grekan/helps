 * order <character> command
 * order all command

 Orders one or all of your charmed followers (including pets) to perform any
command.  The command may have arguments.  You are responsible for the actions
of your followers, and others who attack your followers will incur the same
penalty as if they attacked you directly. 

 Most charmed creatures lose their aggressive nature (while charmed). 

 If your charmed creature engages in combat, that will break the charm.
