Builders and Coders are people who have devoted their time to help improve the
mud for others. Any rudeness directed towards either group for their  work will
not be tolerated. If there is a problem with an area or code, speak or write a
note to 'Builder Immortal' for builder and area related problems or concerns,
or note to 'Coder Immortal' for coding related problems or concerns.  Any
non-constructive criticism or insults to a builder or coder will result in
denial.
