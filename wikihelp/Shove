`8Syntax:`` 

 * shove <target> <target with which first target will be pushed into>

 This is a Legionnaire attack which pushes an opponent into a mob or another
opponent causing them to fight. A very potent attack, but if you fail, then you
will start fighting the person or mob you attempted to shove.
