 * cast 'floating disc'

 This useful spell creates a floating field of force which follows the caster
around, allowing him or her to pile treasure high with no fear of weight
penalties.  It lasts no more than twice the caster's level in hours, and
usually less.  It can hold 10 pounds per level of the caster, with a  maximum
of five pounds per item.  The spell requires an open float location on the
character, and the only way to remove the disc is to die or allow it to run out
of energy.
