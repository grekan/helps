 * cast 'heat metal' <target>

 Heat metal is a powerful clerical attack spell, with effects that vary 
according to the armor of the victim.  It heats up the metal equipment (assumed
to be all weapons and armor at this point in time) on the target, causing him
or her to drop them if possible, taking serious burns in the process (possibly
fatal if the equipment is too heavy to remove easily). This spell does no
damage to creatures who are immune to fire.
