Movement is quite important. There are several ways to move around, including a
number of spells that let you go somewhere really fast, further described in
the transportation spell group helpfile. At first though, the only commands you
need to know about are the directions, recall and some additional commands. 

 `` Firstly, there are the directions. Most rooms have one or more exits,
either north, south, east, west, up or down. Moving in such a direction is done
by typing the direction. Sometimes, there is a door in your way, or another
obstacle, which can be opened by typing open and the direction of the obstacle.
(for instance: open north) `` 

 The recall command is available to you until level 10 and will transport you
back to the safety of the city of Sendar. It does not work in all areas, and
once you hit level 11, you are not able to use it anymore. The word of recall
spell which you will get at some point has the same effect. `` 

 Sometimes you will encounter a portal or gateway of some sort. You can enter
those by typing just that. Enter portal will make you enter a certain portal
(if it has a different name, you should obviously use that name instead of
portal) and take you to the location specified. If you wish to see where a
portal leads, you can look into it first (look in portal). `` 

 You may also use the gate spell to be gate to a player or mob if you have
gained the spell and it cast properly. `` 

 There is also the teleport spell that, when cast correctly, will teleport you
into a random room on the mud. `` 

 This should at least allow you to move around while you get started. If you
have questions then feel free to ask someone. There is also a good selection of
helpfiles that will assist you in finding more information on moving around. ``
