Using a hostel gives you the ability to purchase a room that you can call your
own. These are often used to bot in, or to store items. Anything you leave on
the floor of your hostel room will be saved with the room (so it will still be
in the room after a reboot or crash). The main commands for a hostel are as
follows: 

 purchase buy room:
	 Buys a room at the hostel if you do not already have one. The current
cost for a room is 10000 gold. This gives you a room, a key, and 24 hours of
rent time. Once the room is yours, it is yours for as long as you keep paying
rent upon it. 

 purchase list:
	 (Note to Anheg: Find out what this does) 

 purchase rent <number of hours>:
	 Allows you to buy additional rent time on your room. You can only use
this command once you own a room. Each room starts out with 24 hours of rent
time and this time is ONLY counted down while you are logged on. Once that 24
hours starts to get low (you can see rent time in your score command) you may
purchase additional hours for 500 gold a piece using this command. You must
keep up on your rent in order to keep your room. If you do not keep up on your
rent the room is condemned and your key is taken away. If you let your rent run
out, then decide you want a room again you must use the purchase buy command
and purchase a whole new room.	

 purchase sell price:
	 Evaluates the amount of gold you would get from selling your room.
Note that this will be quite less than what was paid for it. 

 purchase sell room :
	 Actually sells your room. 

 rname <new name>:
	 This command sets the name (what is seen in the where command) of your
room. This is free of charge, but do remember to rsave after making the change 

 rdesc:
	 This will put you into an editor for your room description. Don't
forget to rsave. 

 rsave:
	 Saves any changes made to your room. 

 goroom <owner>:
	 Transports you from the Innkeeper to the section of hallway outside
the person's room, if they have one
