 * cast 'protection good'

 This protection spell reduces damage taken from good attackers, and improves
the resistance against such forms of magic.  It may not be cast on others. Only
one of Protection Good, Protection Neutral and Protection Evil is allowed at
one time unless one or more is a perm spell.
