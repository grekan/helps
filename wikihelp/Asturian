Asturians are very patriotic, but they oftentimes forget to stop and think. 
They are very flighty, and will charge to fight a cause - most any cause -  at
a moment's notice. The Asturians are caught up in a bloody civil war with 
their countrymen, the Mimbrates. It has been said that in the Asturian Forest, 
more arrows are aimed at Knights than at deer.
