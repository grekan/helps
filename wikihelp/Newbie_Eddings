It is quite impossible to teach you exactly what enviroment this game is set
in. The best way to learn is to have read the series by David and Leigh
Eddings, most importantly the `&Belgariad ``and `&Malloreon``. There are also
quite a few internet  sites to be found on the web from which you can gather
some information. It is not required to have some knowledge, but it does add to
the gaming experience to have some additional background information. ``
