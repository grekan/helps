 * wimpy
 * wimpy <number>

 Wimpy sets your wimpy value.  When your character takes damage that reduces
your hit points below your wimpy value, you will automatically attempt to flee.
You will only flee if your character is not in a wait state -- i.e. has not
been using combat commands like cast, trip and bash, and has not been tripped
or bashed by an enemy. 

 Wimpy with no argument sets your wimpy value to 20% of your maximum hit
points. 

 Some monsters have wimpy set.
