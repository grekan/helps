The noteboards on Prophecy replace the bulletin boards and mail systems found
on many other MUDs.  The following options are usable: 

 Reading notes: 

note list	:
	 show all notes (unread notes are marked with an N) 
note read	:
	 either by number, or read next to read unread notes 
note remove	:
	 removes a note that you wrote or are the target of 
note catchup	:
	 marks all notes as read 

 writing new notes: 

note to     :
	 sets the to line (playername, clanname, immortal, or all) 
note subject:
	 sets the subject for a new note 
note +	    :
	 adds a line to a new note (i.e. note + hi guys!) 
note -	    :
	 removes a line from a note in progress 
note clear  :
	 erase a note in progress 
note show   :
	 shows the note you are working on 
note post   :
	 posts a new note. This MUST be done to post a note. 

 When you log in, you will be informed if there are unread notes waiting. Type
note read to scroll through them one at a time. 

 Other note directories exist.	They work the same as the note board, but
replace 'note' with the appropriate command. So to read a new qnote, type
'qnote read,' and to show your current idea, type 'idea show.' 

Ideas Board   :
	This board is strictly used for new ideas involving the mud and its
environment. 
Story Board:
	This board is used to write rp stories about your characters and also a
place to write stories during quests. 
Qnote Board:
	This board is a quest note board. This is used by Emily (help emily)
and also by Quest Immortals to post about rules and upcoming Quests. 
Trade Board:
	This board is used for bounty's on other players heads. 
News Board:
	This board is Immortal only posting. However this is one of the biggest
outlets Immortals use to inform Mortals of New code, New Rules, or other
important information. 
Changes Board:
	Like News, this is Immortal posting only. This is quite like news,
except for instead of posting 'new things' its posting to inform of things that
have been changed. 

 These boards are used the exact same way, for example idea read 5 will read
idea #5.   The 'unread' command can be used to show your unread notes on all
the note spools.
