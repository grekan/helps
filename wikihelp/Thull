Regarded as perhaps the most dim-witted of the Angaraks, Thulls reside in the
plains area to the east of Algaria, south of Gar og Nadrak.  Used en masse as
sacrifices for the Grolims, these pitiful people rely on bluntness, brute
strength, and endurance to survive.   

 Ruled by a puppet King, the only thing that can be said about Thulls is their
willingness to find any means to escape the knives of the Grolims, often found
on the run, or in the case of the females, bearing as many children as
possible.
