 * flee

 Once you start a fight, you can't just walk away from it.  If the fight is not
going well, you can attempt to FLEE, or another character can RESCUE you.  (You
can also RECALL, but this is less likely to work, and costs more experience
points, then fleeing). 

 If you lose your link during a fight, then your character will keep fighting,
and will attempt to RECALL from time to time.  Your chances of making the
recall are reduced, and you will lose much more experience.
