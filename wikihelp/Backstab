 * backstab <target>

 Backstab is the favored attack of thieves, murderers, and other rogues.  It 
can be used with any dam_noun, but is most effective with piercing weapons. The
damage inflicted by a backstab is determined by the attacker's level, his
weapon skill, his backstab skill, and the power of his opponent. 

 Only thieves, spies and poisoners may learn the backstab skill.
