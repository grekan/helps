The leaders of a clan have to abide by a few special rules in addition to all
the usual ones. This is because these individuals are chosen and trusted by the
Immortals and is intended to make sure that trust is well placed. 

 A Clanleader `#must``: 

 * Lead the clan in an evenhanded manner. This means giving a fair chance of
advancement to all members and not favouring friends just because they happen
to be friends.
 * Take care of possible newbies who are clanned. This goes for the entire clan
but the leader should be a role model.
 * Be active. A leader who is deemed inactive (without proper reasons given)
will be replaced.
 * Focus on the leader character, other alts must be secondary.
 * Maintain an RP title. As a Leader he/she should promote and encourage RP.
 * Behave maturely and responsibly at all times.

 A Clanleader must `!not``: 

 * Use Immortal-granted commands for personal reasons. This includes punishing
people for a short moment as a 'joke'. Abusing this will result in the loss of
those commands.
 * Treat the clan bank as his/her personal treasury. The clan bank is there for
the clan and must not be used to buy potions, equipment and so on.
 * Share his/her leader character with anyone else. No exceptions.
 * Have an alt in another PK clan (For PK lords only)

 Breaking the above rules might result in the loss of leadership. 

 Regarding punishments: 

 * Clanleaders will receive an official warning on their first nochannel
offense and will not be nochanneled, but on the second offense they will lose
their leadership.
 * All punishments (nochannel/notitle/noemote/notell/nonote) should be 1 hour``
long. No more, no less. If needed, the Security Immortal will add to it.
