 * cast 'dispel magic' <character>

 This spell remove magical effects from the target.  It has less of a chance of
working than Cancellation, and is considered an attack spell. Unfortunately,
this spell does not discriminate between harmful and benign spells. 

 The chance of dispelling is based on the level of the spell. Permanent spells
(such as mobile sanctuary) are much harder to remove.  Not all spells may be
dispelled; notable examples are poison and plague.
