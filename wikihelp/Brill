Brill is a retired Area and Quest immortal. If it took place on the builder
port then he was likely the person to talk to. Brill dealt with new builder
induction, setting new and old builders up with new or existing areas for them
to edit, checking over completed areas and rewarding builders.	He also held
quests, tending to favour any type of quests that involve mass slaughter on a
reasonable scale.  The best way to contact him was via his email:
assassin.brill@gmail.com
