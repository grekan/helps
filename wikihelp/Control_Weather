`8Syntax:`` 

 * cast 'control weather' better
 * cast 'control weather' worse

 Although tampering with the weather is frowned upon, it is at times necessary.
 Some spells such as Call Lightning require bad weather. On the bright side, it
is possible to make the weather either better or worse depending on what is
needed at the time.
