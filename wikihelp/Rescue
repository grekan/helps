 * Rescue <target>

 A friend in need is a friend indeed and when in combat, a warrior with the
rescue skill is just the friend you need.  Rescue allows you to intercede in
combat, protecting weaker characters from bodily harm. Hopefully, the favor
will be returned.  Success in rescuing depends on the skill rating, as well as
a comparison of level, dexterity, and speed between the character and the
target. (Note: you rescue a friend, not the mob) You can only rescue grouped
players
