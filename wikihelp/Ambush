 * ambush <target>

 The skill of laying an ambush is one readily used by those familiar to the
outdoor life and using the terrain to their advantage, such as rangers.  To lay
an ambush the attacker must first hide themselves before launching their
assault, often resulting in multiple attacks in succession while simultaneously
stunning their opponent as they are caught unawares.  However an opponent can
not be caught out in this way forever as eventually they will be expecting the
attack.
