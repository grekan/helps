`8Syntax:``  

 * stick <player>

 This will open an OLC style interactive editor where you can type a note about
the player.  Players with such notes stuck to them will be tagged with a
[Sticky] flag on the who list.	To view or modify the note, use the same 'stick
<player>' command.  This works with both online and offline players.
