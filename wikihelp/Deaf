 * deaf

 The deaf toggle turns off incoming tells, helpful if you are being bombarded
by messages from other players.  You can still use reply (see 'help reply') to
reply to people who were telling you before you went deaf, although you cannot
reply to a deaf person unless you or they are a deity (it's mostly useful for
sending a quick "I'm being spammed so I went deaf" message to a person).
