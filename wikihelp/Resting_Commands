`8Syntax:``  

 * rest
 * sleep
 * stand
 * wake

 These commands change your position.  When you REST or SLEEP, you  regenerate
hit points, mana points, and movement points faster. However, you are more
vulnerable to attack, and if you SLEEP, you won't hear many things happen. 

 Use STAND or WAKE to come back to a standing position.  You can also WAKE
other sleeping characters.
