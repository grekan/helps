For room, mob, or extra descriptions, a text editor known as "append mode" is
used when you type "desc" (redit or medit) or "ed add"/"ed edit" (redit or
oedit). 

 There will be a prompt saying "Entering append mode, type .h on a blank line
for help, terminate with a ~ or a @ on a blank line", then a few lines under
that, a ">" prompt. Whatever you type after that > will be entered as part of
that description, so watch what you're typing :) Type it line for line, as
every time you hit the enter key, it will sort the line you just typed and get
ready for a new line to be input. 

 Commands (listed when you type ".h" on a clean line) 
 .f :
 
: Formats the lines to word wrapping, making the desc look like an even block
paragraph rather than a jumble of cut off lines. Please note that the colour
characters are counted in the word wrapping. 
 .s :
 
: Shows what you've typed so far, in case you forget. 
 .c :
 
: Clears the ENTIRE desc, to start over again. 
 .r "old string" "new string" :
 
: Replaces the old string with the new string, Be sure to include the "" marks.
	 This is quite useful. First, type your desc in regular white coloring.
Then, if you want to add color, .r "plain word" "word with color code". The
reason for this is the fact that the color code characters are factored as part
of the word wrap, so it makes the paragraph look ill-formatted if you add color
first.	     Example:	     > Red roses are here.   > .f
	 > .r "Red roses" "`1Red`` roses" 
 .h :
 
: Lists the commands and their uses. 
 @ :
 
: Save what you've typed and exits append mode.
