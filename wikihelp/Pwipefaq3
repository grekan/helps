`` `#Question`3: `&What will the pwipe mean to me?`` `` 

 `@Answer`2:`` `& 

 The pwipe will mean that you will have to start anew. To say it quite bluntly,
you will have no character and thus have to create a fresh one with which to
play with the balanced old and new features, trying to gain power in whichever
way you see fit. You can choose to play around with the new features or try to
rise above the rest as soon as possible, the choice is yours. ``
