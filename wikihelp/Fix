 * fix [objectname]

 Fix is the command for compacting item stats.	For example, turning multiple
instances of "Affects hp by x" into a single affect.  It also imposes maximum
limits, as described in "help qlist" at time of writing (-30 ac, -10 saves, 3
to each stat, 10 hit 10 dam, 120 hp, 120 mana, 120 move).  With regard to
spells and resistances/vulnerabilities on eq, care should be taken, though
there is a wiznet reminder.  These affects are copied straight across without
any alteration, due to the multitude of different ways they can be done.  This
means that, in the case of certain affects, primarily where they are "attached"
to others (For example, old dead robes, where the resistances were part of the
6 dam affect, or old snake of nineheads, where the haste was part of the 3 dam)
there can be duplication (Fixing a stock old dead would result in a piece with
12 dam, as it processes the 6 dam that it finds the item adds in total, then
duplicates the affect with reses (which also has the 6 dam)) If there is
duplication, the item should be remade with perms/reses/vulns added in the
current appropriate manner (perm/apply, rather than set) 

 Note should also be taken that the item will "move" to the first position in
your inventory, if not already there (This is because it works by creating a
new object, and copying the old affects across, before removing the old
object).   

 Thanks to Naradas for his recode of qenchant, and to the writer of do_clone,
from both of which code was used.
