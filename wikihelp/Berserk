 * berserk

 Only powerful Cherek warriors can master berserk, the ability to enter insane 
rage in combat.  Its effects are not altogether unlike the frenzy spell -- a
huge surge of combat prowess, coupled with a disregard for personal safety.  
Berserk warriors are more resistant to the effects of magic.
