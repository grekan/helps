Penalties are the result of breaking a rule. The following list of penalties
only applies to a first offense. Any and all penalties are kept track of by the
immortals, and repeat offenders will receive harsher penalties. At the time of
offense, the penalty will be the same as a first offense. Once the Security
Immortal(s) record that information, if it is found that it is not a first
offense, a harsher penalty will be delivered at the discretion of the Security
Immortal(s). See `8<`&help penalties`8>`` for more information, and `8<`&help
