 * sneak

 Sneak lets a character move unseen from room to room, and also to not be
noticed while stationary. This is at the cost of more movement points when
actually moving. It can be stopped with the visible command, or by attacking
something. Players and mobiles affected by the detect hidden spell will be able
to see a stationary character, but will not see them moving.
