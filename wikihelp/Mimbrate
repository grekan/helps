Mimbrates speak with the old tongue, meaning a lot of thee's and thou's. They
take pride in their appearance, and spend much time shining their armor. Bored 
barons will use their free time sending their serfs to war with other barons 
just to prove a petty point. Mimbrates are very proper and gallant, and they 
ALWAYS follow the Knight's Code of Honor. Mimbrates never say no to a fight,
and they can be particularly hot-tempered when it comes to their Asturian
cousins.
