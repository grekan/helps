 * cast fireproof <object>

 The fireproof spell creates a short-lived protective aura around an object, to
protect it from the harmful effects of acid and flame.	Items protected by this
spell are not harmed by acid, fire, or the heat metal spell. Although
inexpensive to use, the spell's short duration makes it impractical for
protecting large numbers of objects.
