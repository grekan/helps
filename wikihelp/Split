`8Syntax:``  

 * SPLIT <silver> <gold>

 Split splits some coins  between you and all the members of your group who are
in the same room as you.  It's customary to split the loot after a kill.  The
first argument is the amount of `7s`8i`&lv`8e`7r`` the split (0 is acceptable),
and the second `3gold`` (optional). 

 Examples: 

 split 30	 --> split 30 `7s`8i`&lv`8e`7r`` 

 split 20 50	 --> split 20 `7s`8i`&lv`8e`7r``, 50 `3gold`` 

 split	0 10	 --> split 10 `3gold``
