Roleplaying is the act of playing your character "properly" in conjunction with
 the theme of Prophecy. It is not necessary to read The Belgariad or The
Mallorean  to do this, but it would give greater insight as to how to properly
act on your  character. A good choice of roleplaying is a Tolnedran warrior in
the [Legions] clan. A poor example would be a Cherek sorcerer in the [Angarak]
clan. Reading the  helpfiles RP_HOWTO, RACE, CLASS, CLANS, and ENEMIES are a
must.
