`` Pretitles are another way with which Prophecy encourages RP on the MUD.
People may earn titles through their RP skills, both real time and storyboard,
and with the use of roleplaying points. `` 

 There are some rules and guidelines for earning or purchasing a pretitle: `` 

 `#1`3)`` It should be an RP title.  `` 

 `#2`3)`` It cannot violate any rule for channels or "help name" in any way,
though of course the no-title rule may be disregarded. `` 

 `#3`3)`` When you are in a clan, your pretitle may never (appear to) outrank
your clan's lord's title, unless acquired before joining the clan. `` 

 `#4`3)`` When you purchase a pretitle, RP is expected, before and after you
acquire it. `` 

 There are several pretitles to buy, and you have a choice, be it somewhat
limited, in the matter and there are three levels of pretitles, being: `` 
`6-`^- `&1st Level Pretitle``:
 
: Master/Mistress/Goodman/Etc ``	These pretitles cost 7500 RPpts, and
there are no further requirements apart from roleplaying the part. Knights
cannot acquire this pretitle. `` 
`6-`^- `&2nd Level Pretitle``:
 
: Minor nobility, such as a baroncy. `` 	These pretitles cost 7500 RPpts
and require you to have a 1st level pretitle. Also, RP is required, before and
after you acquire it, as well as a storyboard note on how you acquired the
title. Knights pay double for this pretitle. `` 
`6-`^- `&3rd Level Pretitle``:
 
: Slightly higher than 2nd Level Pretitle.  ``	These pretitles cost 5000 RPpts
and require you to have a 2nd level pretitle. Roleplaying is required, before
and after you acquire it, as well as a multi-storyboard post on how you
recieved the title. `` 

 Please note that the examples stated above, do not have to apply for all races
and classes and, if given an RP reason, can be altered slightly. For example, a
priest could choose Cantor instead of Master. If your pretitle is awarded or if
there are more requirements to be met, is up to the immortal's discretion. ``
