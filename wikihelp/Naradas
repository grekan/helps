Naradas was Prophecy's head-coder and was responsible for many of the nice
pieces of work that enhance your playing experience, such as Emily, but also a
lot of vital underlying code. All Naradas-en should be handled with extreme
care, fed with beans and bacon, and kept out of the rain at all cost.
