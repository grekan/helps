An aggressive action is any action that will harm another player.  PK  players
may not take aggressive actions against non-pk players, and non-pk players  may
not take aggressive actions towards PK or non-PK players. 

 An example of an aggressive action is to move an aggressive mob into a room
that will attack other players, or summon a character to a room with an
aggressive mobile.
