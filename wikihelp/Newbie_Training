`` Two (important) ways of enhancing your character are practicing and
training. This helpfile will give a brief explanation of what these are. `` 
`6-`^- `&Training``:
 
: `` `` 

 Training is a way of enhancing your attributes/statistics or your
mana/hitpoints or movement. After you create a character, you get three
training points (trains) and you will get one more each time you level. Though
you can choose to enhance your statistics, such as strength or dexterity using
your trains, equipment is usually sufficient to reach the maximum limits of
those so you can use your trains for something a little more beneficial. Most
people choose to use their trains on training hitpoints (hp), which means that
they get an extra 10 hitpoints per level. A trainer can be found `&3`` south,
`&3`` east, `&1`` south from the recall location. `` 
`6-`^- `&Practicing``:
 
: `` `` 

 Practicing is also quite important as you can increase your ability in skills
and spells with it, up to a maximum of 75%. You can check the current
percentage of your skills and spells by typing practice. The higher the number
the lesser the chance of you failing at the skill or spell. To practice you
will need practice points. How many you will have is dependant on your wisdom
statistic. When you practice, you should at all times have your intelligence at
maximum to gain the most from each practice point. A good place to practice (or
even train for that matter) can be found `&2`` south, `&16`` east, `&2`` south
and `&1`` east from the recall point. `` 
`6-`^- `&Advanced``:
 
: `` `` 

 Some people choose not to use practices to become better at skills but instead
they convert 10 practice points into one train to train hitpoints or mana. This
is done with the "`&gain convert``" command, at the location of mentioned in
the practice section of this helpfile.	``
