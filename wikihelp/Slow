 * cast 'slow' <target>

 Despite popular mythology, slow is not the opposite of haste, but is a spell
with its own unique set of effects.  When cast on an unfortunate victim, it
slows its movements, making it easier to hit and reducing its rate of attack. 
The effect of slow also doubles movement costs and halves healing rates, due to
reduced metabolism.
