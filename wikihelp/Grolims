Grolims are the priests of Torak, with powers that match those of sorcerers,
and  they are fierce fighters with that. They are the incarnation of pure evil,
and at their rituals, they offer the hearts of the common people, often Thulls.
Most Grolims lost their faith or went nuts after the death of Torak, but a
select group, went on believing and grew much more powerful.
