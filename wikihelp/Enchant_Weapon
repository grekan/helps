 * cast 'enchant weapon' <weapon>

 This spell magically enchants a weapon, increasing its to-hit and to-dam
bonuses by one or two points.  Multiple enchants may be cast, but as the weapon
grows more and more powerful, it is more likely to be drained or destroyed by
the magic.  Also, every successful enchant increases the level of the weapon by
one...and there is no turning back. See Enchantment.
