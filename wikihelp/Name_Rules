Here in the age of Prophecy, choosing a name is more than just a means of
identifying your character.  This is a MUD based on the Belgariad and 
Malloreon, two great series written by David and Leigh Eddings. 

 The immortal staff and players encourage you to choose a fictional name, one 
that is original and unique, not only to the realm of Prophecy but to the 
entirety of known fiction.  Think of it as making up a new character for a book
 that nobody has ever read about, then setting this brand new character into
the  storyline of Prophecy.  This in turn will help create a more positive
roleplaying  environment for everyone.	Players with names that Immortals deem
unacceptable will  be asked to come up with another name with which to go by. 

 Illegal/Unacceptable names are ones that: 

 * Begin with the prefix Pol, Bel, or Kal
 * Are from any Eddings works (Belgariad, Elenium, Althalus, etc.)
 * Are silly or funny (Jello, Buffalobill, Buchkwheet, etc.)
 * Contain offensive words (in any language).
 * Contain two parts/words (RedBaron, Whiteknight, DeathdealerofDoom)
 * Do not fit your race (Lily the Murgo, Grimdark the Cherek)
 * Belong to common mobs on the MUD (dragon, guard, etc.)
 * Presume titles (Princekel or LordDoomHammer, etc.)
 * Are Mythological or Biblical such as Job, Zeus, Aphrodite
 * Are modern and/or common (John, Sarah, Mike, Katy, etc.)
 * Are from other books, video games, etc. (Lancelot, Sephiroth, etc.)
 * Mean words in other languages (Swedish, Singaporean, Spanish...)
 * Are English words (If we can look it up in a dictionary, it won't fly)

 We would like all the players to have unique fantasy names, and if all the
players can meet this criteria, the roleplaying environment in Prophecy will be
much more enjoyable.
