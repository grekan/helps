`` When you first create a character on `&Prophecy``, the name will have to be
validated. Until you are validated, you are restricted in several ways: for 
instance, you can not write notes or use any of the public channels. All
immortals have the validation command and so do a few mortals who are trusted
enough. `` 

 Whether or not you will be validated depends mostly on whether your name is
legal or not <help name> and whether or not there are alot of objections from
both the immortal staff and your fellow mortals. If your name is legal and
there are no real objections then you will be validated. `` 

 If for some reason your name is not legal, then you will not have to recreate.
Immortals have the power to rename you, after discussing a proper name, which
you will use from that point onward. `` 

 If you wish to get validated and you see no people with the power to do so,
you may use the pray channel to ask for it, but asking repeatedly will not
result in swifter validation. Do not nag to get validated.  Someone will get to
it soon enough. ``
