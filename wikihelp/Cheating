A so called 'bug' is a feature that you can use in a way that it wasn't
intended for -- perhaps in order to gain something for you or your character.
This includes, but is in no way limited to, abusing bugs to powerlevel, crash
the mud or clone eq.  The definition of a 'bug' is done on a case-by-case basis
by the immortal staff.	Abusing a bug is illegal, as is not reporting a
discovered bug. (see help bug) 

 If you feel someone has done something that is illegal, send a note to Anheg
and Immortal and explain the situation in a short and concise matter. You will
get a personal response as soon as possible. 

 If you feel that you have been treated unfairly by an immortal, first try to
talk to the immortal about it. If you still don't agree, note to 'Immortal' and
explain the situation. We will get back to you as soon as we can. `!Never note
to 'all'``. 

 If you suspect an immortal of cheating or showing favoritism, email to
'anheg@prophecy.lu'. We see abusive behavior from immortals as a very serious
matter and it is our firm belief and intent to immediately delete any cheating
immortal. 

 Above all, when dealing with immortals, remember that playing here is a
privilege, not a right.
