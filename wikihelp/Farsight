`8Syntax:`` 

 * cast 'farsight'
 * cast 'farsight' <direction>

 The farsight spell expands the caster's consciousness, allowing him or her to
see far away beings like they were in the same room.  It takes intense
concentration, often leaving the caster helpless for several minutes. The spell
may be used for a general scan that reaches a short distance in all directions,
or with a directional component to see creatures much farther away.
