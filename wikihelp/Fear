 * cast fear <target>

 The fear spell is a spell in the emotions spell group that when cast upon the
target opponent, if you get the right roll, they will cringe in fear and flee.
This also raises their wimpy to a high number so that whenever they are hit
after that (until they reset their wimpy), they will flee after an 
undetermined number of rounds of combat. Very useful for evading dying against
player killers and high level mobs.
