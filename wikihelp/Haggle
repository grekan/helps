Haggling is an indispensable skill to the trader.  It allows a character to
match wits with a merchant, seeking to get a better price for merchandise, or
to buy at the lowest possible cost.  Unfortunately, most merchants are	already
very skilled at haggling, so the untrained adventurer had best	guard his
treasure closely.  Thieves are natural masters at haggling,  although other
classes may learn it as well.
