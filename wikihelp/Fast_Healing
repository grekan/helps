The fast healing skill improves wound healing rates, whether walking, resting,
or sleeping. It represents knowledge of healing herbs or just general 
toughness and stamina.	Fast healing is checked every tick, and it is  possible
for it to fail.  All classes may learn this skill, but sorcerers find it very
difficult to master, due to their bookish lifestyle.
