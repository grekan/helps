 * validate <name>

 This command is given to Immortals and Clan Lords... There are certain
guidelines that are expected to be followed when a character is up for
validation.   

 1.  Check 'help name' and make sure it does not break any of	 Prophecy's
name rules. 

 2.  Pick your favorite search engine (i.e. Yahoo, Google, Lycos) and type in
the name.  This makes sure it's not the name of the largest nylon sock company
in Cambodia. 

 3.  Ask in OOC if there are any reasonable objections to this name. 

 A name should pass all of these steps before being validated.
