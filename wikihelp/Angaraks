Residing in the eastern half of the world, the Angaraks make up the population
that follow the Dragon-God, Torak.  Split into different castes historically,
they are made up of the Murgos, Nadraks, Malloreans, and Thulls. 

 Fear commonly rules the people, as they are under the guidance of Grolims, and
a standing army is always at the ready to do war upon the Alorns for the many
grievances done throughout time.
