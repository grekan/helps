 * brew '<spell>' (must have an empty vial)

 The brew skill allows those that have it to brew their own spells that they
have reached into vials that can be bought in Sendar. You must hold an empty
vial in your hand and type "brew 'spell'". There is a percentage that your vial
will blow up and you will be harmed by it but when you get it right, you'll
have a spell in a bottle.
