'Immortal' refers to players who have been promoted by the Head Administrators
to any level beyond 91. Immortals are capable of exceeding the	usual game
limitations and their abilities range from mere transportation of  themselves,
invisibility and creation of objects to such things as removal of  a player's
privileges like channels, healthpoints or even the ability to log on. 

 Since immortals can wreak havoc with game balance, they are a carefully chosen
and policed group. An absolute rule of immortal behavior is that no immortal
can aid or assist any player without explicit permission from the higher ranks;
in other words, please don't ask an immortal to help you kill a mob, gather EQ
and so on,  or you'll likely be either politely or rudely refused, or referred
to this file. 

 The duties of the immortals are many and varies from individual to individual.
The thing they all have in common though is that they will always try to
maintain the fundamentals of the MUD and to keep it flowing  in an orderly
fashion. In other words, their primary function is to make  sure that the MUD
is enjoyable for the players.
