`8Syntax:`` 

 * log <character>
 * log all

 Log <character> causes all of a character's commands to be logged into the
server's log file.  Like Freeze, it is a permanent character toggle. Logs may
only be used by creators and implementers, and should be accompanied by mail to
the implementers. 

 Certain commands (Password) are protected against log.  Conversely, certain
commands (especially immortal commands) are always logged. 

 Log all logs all character commands.  It is a server-wide toggle; it does not
persist across reboots. Please do not use this unless you tell the imps.
