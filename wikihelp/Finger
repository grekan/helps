 * finger <victim>
 * finger real <name>
 * finger email <address>

 Finger allows the player to obtain information on players, whether online or
offline. The "finger real" and "finger email" allow you to set your real name
and email address as seen by other players fingering you. It will also, if
fingering a mortal, allow you to see when they were last online.
