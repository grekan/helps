Newbies are new characters to Prophecy or to MUDs in general.  The MUD school
can teach basic walking, looking, and attacking commands to new  players. 
Also, newbies are encouraged to read helpfiles, and ask any questions they may
have of Shepherds (see "help Shepherds"), or of other online characters.  Once
a newbie reaches level 26, they are considered a Lowbie.
