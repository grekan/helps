 * cast 'curse' <character | object>

 This spell will reduce a targets to-hit roll and spell resistance.  It also
renders the target unclean in the eyes of the Gods, thus making them unable to
use recall, clan recall, or the "word of recall" spell. 

 Curse may also be used to fill equipment with evil power, allowing weapons to
do more damage to holy opponents, while also making the weapon force its
wielder to want to hold it harder, making it more difficult to be disarmed.
