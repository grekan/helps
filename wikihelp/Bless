`8Syntax:`` 

 * cast bless <character>
 * cast bless <object>

 This spell improves the to-hit roll and saving throw versus spell of the
target character by 1 for every 8 levels of the caster. It may also be cast on
an object to temporarily bless it (blessed weapons, for example, are more
effective against demonic beings).
